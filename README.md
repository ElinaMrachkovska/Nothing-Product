## Technical Highlights

Clear Product Focus: A minimalist landing page designed for the presentation of tech products (phones, earphones, accessories).

Modern Markup: Utilizes HTML5 with semantic markup for improved indexing and accessibility.

Modular Styling: SCSS (Sass) with a modular block structure for styles—easier to maintain and scale the UI.

Naming Convention: BEM notation for classes (e.g., .icon, .icon--phone, .icon--menu) ensures a clear and maintainable naming system for components.

Responsive Design Tools: Use of Mixins for breakpoints (@include on-tablet, @include on-desktop) to ensure responsiveness without code duplication.

Interactive UI Details: Subtle interactive UI elements: hover effects and transitions (e.g., phone number tooltip using ::before, icon scaling).

Build Tool: Uses Parcel as the bundler—provides a fast dev server, straightforward image hashing, and asset processing.

Asset Management: Organized structure for static resources (PNG) and an organized src/images structure for product visuals.

Deployment: Support for publishing on GitHub Pages (demo link in the README) for simple deployment.

Design Synchronization: Design maintained in Figma (link in README) for precise layout reproduction and quick discussion of changes.

Performance and Simplicity: Focused on performance and simplicity: minimal third-party dependencies, emphasis on product visuals.

Scalable Foundation: A good basis for expansion: component structure for styles and clear locations for adding new products/components.
